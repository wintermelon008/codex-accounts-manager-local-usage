## Overview

### Quota Dashboard

The extension provides a Webview dashboard for managing and monitoring all saved Codex accounts in one place:

- Current account summary with team info and quick actions
- Quota gauges for 5-hour, weekly, and code review usage
- Saved accounts list for multi-account management
- Quick actions for add, import, and refresh-all

### Multi-Account Management

- Add a new account through OAuth
- Detect an existing local Codex `auth.json` when no account has been saved yet
- Bind the detected local account into the extension with one click
- Import the currently active local Codex `auth.json`
- Refresh quota immediately after local bind or import
- Store multiple accounts locally
- Switch the active account with one click
- Remove accounts you no longer use

### Cross-Window Sync

- Watch global `auth.json` changes
- Automatically sync the active account when another VS Code window switches accounts
- Prompt the current window to reload when an external account switch is detected

### Codex App Integration

- Detect whether Codex App is installed when switching accounts
- Automatically restart Codex App if it is already running
- Skip restart if the desktop app is installed but not currently running
- Currently supports common macOS, Windows, and Linux install/process patterns

### Quota Visibility

Each account can show:

- 5-hour quota percentage
- Weekly quota percentage
- Code review quota percentage
- Reset countdown
- Last refresh time

### Status Bar Monitoring

- Show the current account quota summary in the VS Code status bar
- Pin selected accounts from the dashboard into status visibility
- Click the status bar entry to open the full quota dashboard

### Multilingual UI

- Automatically follows the current VS Code display language
- Primary support for Simplified Chinese and English, with additional localization for other languages
- Dashboard copy, prompts, and interaction text switch with the editor language
- You can also force this extension to use Simplified Chinese, English, or another supported language without changing the rest of VS Code

### Details Panel

Open a per-account details panel to inspect:

- Account email
- Team / organization information
- User ID / account ID
- Raw quota payload

## Settings

You can change these directly from the settings button in the top-right corner of the dashboard, or from VS Code Settings by searching for `codexAccounts`.

- `Language`
  - `Auto (follow VS Code)`, `Simplified Chinese`, `English`, and other supported languages
  - Only affects Codex Accounts Manager dashboard copy and prompt text
- `Codex App Restart Policy`

  - Can be disabled, or set to `5 / 10 / 15 / 30 / 60` minutes
  - Disabled by default
  - When disabled, no timed refresh runs
- `5-hour Quota Control`
  - Disabled by default; the 5-hour quota remains visible while disabled
  - Controls whether a valid 5-hour quota can trigger automatic switching or quota warnings
- `Automatic Account Switching`
  - Disabled by default
  - When enabled, set separate thresholds for `5-hour` and `weekly` quota
  - After refresh, the extension can switch to another saved account when the active one hits a threshold
  - The 5-hour threshold only applies while `5-hour Quota Control` is enabled; the weekly threshold remains independent

  - Only quota windows returned by the API are checked; while 5-hour control is disabled, only the weekly quota is checked
